calcFst computes Weir and Cockerham (1984) Fst.

to compile:
gcc -c src/Fst_geno.c
gcc -c src/get_geno.c
gcc -c src/read_params.c
gcc src/calcFst.c *.o -o calcFst

to run:
if the data consists chromosomes with SNPs coded with 0/1
./calFst HAPLOID 
-i "File containing the genotypes"
-p "File containing the population of each individual coded from 1 to n"
-o "output file with the Fst". Default is Fsts

if the data consists of genotypes with SNPs coded with 0/1/2
./calFst DIPLOID
-i "File containing the genotypes"
-p "File containing the population of each individual coded from 1 to n"
-o "output file with the Fst". Default is Fsts

let nIND be the number of individuals in the data.
genotype file contains one row per snp. markers are separated by a white blank. If data are Diploid, nIND values per line. If Data are Haploid nIND*2 values per line.

Population file contains one row with the population of each individual coded from 1 to n. This file must contain nIND values, whether data are Diploid or Haploid.


EXAMPLE:
./calcFst HAPLO -i Example/Data_Haplo -p Example/Pops.txt
